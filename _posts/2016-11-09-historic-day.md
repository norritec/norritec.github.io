Today is a historic day for our country.  We have just elected a new president and now maybe this once great county can get back on track.  Congratulations to President Trump, now lets see what you can do for this country and it's people.  

I know that I have not been do regular blog postings on here.  I hope to get back on track with this and start doing weekly post of the things I am working on.  Everyone have a wonderful day and remember to do what you love and love what you do!

Keep coding!
