I just thought I would give a little updat on my Simple Notes app that I am currently working on.   It is turning out to be more than just a simple note
taking app.  It has become more of a beast that just keeps growing.  It am going to have to wrangle in some of the additions that I have been addiing
to it as I go.  As always keep checking back to see more of the updates.  I will add some screen shots in the near future for everyone to see.
