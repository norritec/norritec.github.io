Today is Tuesday, and I am getting back into the swing of coding for the week after working all weekend and finally taking a day off with my wife yesterday.  It was a nice change for both of us to finally have a day off together.  

### Coding Goals for the Week

This week I am finishing up my Calculator app, then I am planning on working on a Weather app that I have in mind.  Depending how things are going I am hoping to have the Weather app up on Google Play by the time I go back to work on Friday.

### Additional Goals

I want to add a 4 terabyte external hard drive to my network.  The only complication of this that I need to be able to access it by both my MacBook Pro and my desktop PC.  Currently the hard drive works fine on both computers but when I plug it into my Linksys router it does not show up.  All the documentation shows that it needs to be either a Fat32 or NFTS.  The only problem is getting the MacBook to read the hard drive on the network.

#### Todo's for the Network

* [] Format the hard drive
* [] Connect it to the network
* [] Setup files containing media
* [] Setup files for documents for each member of the family
* [] Setup the security for each member.
* [] Give everyone there access codes for it.


So now its time to get started with the day and crush everything and make things happen.  Keep coding everyone.
