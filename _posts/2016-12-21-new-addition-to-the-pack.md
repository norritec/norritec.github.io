For the longest time my step-daughter has wanted either a German Shepherd or a Belgian Malinois for her dog.  Well, last week I ran across a young couple who was having to get rid of their 7 month old Dutch Shepherd, a cousin of the the others.  I was able to work out a deal for this young female shepherd for my step-daughter. On this past Sunday when my step-daughter arrived home from spending the weekend with her best friend we gave her an early Christmas present.  These two have been insuperable since then.  We are very happy with the addition of Nala to the pack.
