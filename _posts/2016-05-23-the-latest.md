Well, I have been out of school for almost a month now and it has been an interesting
few weeks for me.  I have continued to work on my Android app and I have been
spending almost as much time reflecting on what I learned in school in my
programming classes.  I have actually started over with some of my Java programming
and refreshing myself with everything I should know.  I am not sure about everyone else
but I know that I feel that there was tons that I missed the first time around.

Some days when I set down at the computer to start working on something I feel that everything slips away and I can not remember even the simplest of things when it comes to my coding.  I know that it will all come together with practice and be like I have been doing it all of my life.  Sometimes though I wish it would all come together faster.  But that is just me.
