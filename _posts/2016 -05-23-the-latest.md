Well, I have been out of school for almost a month now and it has been an interesting
few weeks for me.  I have continued to work on my Android app and I have been
spending almost as much time reflecting on what I learned in school in my
programming classes.  I have actually started over with some of my Java programming
and refreshing myself with everything I should know.  I am not sure about everyone else
but I know that I feel that there was tons that I missed the first time around.
