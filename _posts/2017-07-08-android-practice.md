Today I am spending some time working on Android apps and continuing to increase my skills as a developer.  The only problem working from home is the five highly active dogs that we have.  One of them is constantly wanting attention and to play.  But let's see what we can do about doing some coding.

### Calculator App

Today's app of choice is a Calculator app.  I have built one before when I was in school but I wanted to go back and see what I could do and make it a little better now.

The image above is of the MainActivity of the app and so far the coding is going smoothly.  It has been a little more detailed than I was planning for today but it looks good.
