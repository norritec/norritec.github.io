Hope everyone is having a great start to the summer.  Since school has been out my step-son went to Chicago
to spend a few weeks with his dad and my step-daughter will be going up in a couple of more weeks to see him.
My step-daughter has also started working on getting her learners permit this pas week.  Also this week I picked
up a freelance gig for a big project for a startup.  So I have been working on designs and mock ups of Android
apps and a website for them to see.  It has been so long since I have done any real web development I have to
do some brushing up on the material.  This is going to be a big project and they want to go live with the apps
and website on Oct 1st of this year.  So I guess I will be spending my summer on the computer instead of taking
the family for another trip to Walt Disney World.

I am stoked for doing this project for this company and even know the deadline is just a few months away
I am not feeling stressed about any of the project at all.  I actually work better under the pressures of deadlines.
I hope to show the app and the website to some of y'all soon during beta testing.  I will post a link in the next few
weeks for the website so we can take some beta testers.

Have a wonderful Sunday and remember to keep on coding!
