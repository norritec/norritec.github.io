Now that school is out and I am about to graduate it is time to start thinking about doing some Android applications for
myself.  I have several ideas running through my head of things that I would like to do and see, but which one do I pluck
and start on this week.  I have been kicking around something simple and oh so very common like a Notes app.  It seems
like that seems to be what everyone starts with after they get done with school.  My problem with it is that I do not what
just a plan everyday note app.  I want all of the bells and whistles on mine.  Listed below are just some of the things I want
to do with my app:
    - Take notes(obviously)
    - Share the notes
    - Camera/Video
    - Dropbox
    - GoogleDrive
    - Geo-location
    - Manage by Order

Those are just to name a few of the ideas for what I want mine to have.  I will be starting this probably tomorrow since Tiff,
my wife, is flying home this afternoon.  She was at Walt Disney World for some training for booking Disney travel for people.
I will be posting my progress on here and you can check out my postings on GitHub as I go as well.
