        <p>My name is Michael, and I used to be a photojournalist.  Now, I am a Android App Developer who is striving to improve his skills daily.  So, how did I get to this point in my life?  Please read on....</p>

</h3>

<p>I first picked up a camera in high school and after that I never put it down.  After years of bouncing around from job to job and not knowing what I wanted to do with my life I started working in the medical field back in the late 90's in a Neonatal unit working with premature babies.  So some time after my first son was born in late 2000 I picked a camera back up and started taking photos again.  Fast forwarding about 8 years and a second son later and working 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, I was offered a job with a newspaper as a staff-photojournalist.  </p>

<p>A couple of years into my career as a photojournalist I sidelined with a surgery for a few weeks and to occupy my time I decided I wanted to build a website to show off my images.  I spent some time teaching myself what to do and then early one morning about a week later I published my first website.  It was very crude, but nonetheless it was up and running.  </p>

<p>After watching the news industry change to what it is now I decided to go back into freelance photography.  After enjoying some time doing this I found myself back working in the medical field a couple days a week and freelancing the others.  Not one to be ideal I decide to go back to college at the ripe age of 44 and finish an IT degree I had started when I was much younger.  I decided to change the direction of the degree and went with IT Mobile App Developer bringing us up to now.  </p>

<p>Thank you for stopping by to see my work!</p>
